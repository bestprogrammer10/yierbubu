### Story BGM: Two Minute Transformation (两分钟变身)
- **Story Context**: A lighthearted track mirroring the contrast between Yi Er's long, anxious preparation and Bu Bu's instant, stylish transformation.
- **Main Style**: Instrumental City Pop / Future Funk / Synthwave
- **BPM**: 115 (Shifts to half-time feel at the end)
- **Dynamic Progression**:
    - **Intro (0:00-0:40)**: Light, bouncy staccato synth keys (plucky sounds). Represents the cute but busy morning routine.
    - **Build-up (0:40-1:10)**: 808 hi-hats start rattling (trap influence) mixed with a "ticking clock" woodblock sound. The melody becomes repetitive and rising, creating a comedic sense of urgency/panic.
    - **The Drop (1:10-End)**: A sudden "tape stop" effect. Then, a deep, smooth, sexy Slap Bass groove kicks in with a wailing Saxophone or confident Electric Guitar solo. The tempo feels slower and cooler (half-time), representing Bu Bu's sudden "male model" aura.
- **Key Elements**:
    - **Drums**: TR-808 (Crisp snare. "Ticking" percussion in middle section).
    - **Bass**: Bouncy synth bass in intro -> Driving octave bass in build-up -> Complex Slap Bass in outro.
    - **Lead Instrument**: Bright Synth Bell (Intro) -> Saxophone (Outro/Cool part).
- **Vibe Description**: The track is a musical joke. It starts cute and anxious, building up stress like a cartoon chase scene, then instantly resolves into the coolest, smoothest 80s elevator-funk imaginable, emphasizing the "Cool Guy" transformation.
- **Prompt for Music AI**:
  - **Chinese**: 纯音乐，无歌词，城市流行，808鼓机，可爱前奏，中间节奏加快带来喜剧紧迫感（时钟滴答声），最后突然变奏为丝滑帅气的慢板放克（萨克斯独奏），强烈的反差，抓耳。
