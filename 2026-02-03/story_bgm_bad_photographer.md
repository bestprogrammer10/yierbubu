### Story BGM: Shutter Love Chaos (快门下的甜蜜混乱)

- **Story Context**: Bu Bu confidently directs Yi Er in a photoshoot that turns into a disaster of funny photos, ending in a playful chase.
- **Main Style**: Instrumental City Pop / Kawaii Future Bass
- **BPM**: 124 (Upbeat & Bouncy)
- **Dynamic Progression**:
    - **Intro (Sc. 1-2)**: Sparkly chimes and light synth pads. Sweet, confident, and hopeful.
    - **Verse (Sc. 3-5)**: A steady, driving 808 beat kicks in. Funky slap bass line. The melody is catchy and energetic as Bu Bu gives directions.
    - **Bridge (Sc. 6-7)**: The music abruptly pauses or "glitches" (record scratch effect), then drops into a comedic, slightly off-key or "wobbly" synth melody representing the ugly photos.
    - **Chorus/Outro (Sc. 8)**: Explodes into a fast-paced, high-energy chase theme with a prominent 808 kick and playful synth leads. Ends with a sweet, fading major chord.
- **Key Elements**:
    - **Drums**: TR-808 with bouncy hi-hats.
    - **Bass**: Funky, bubbling synth bass.
    - **Synth**: Bright, "super saw" chords for the chorus; cute "pluck" sounds for the intro.
    - **Lead Instrument**: A cheerful Synth Lead playing a hummable melody (replacing vocals).
- **Vibe Description**: A sweet and energetic track that starts with romantic confidence, stumbles into comedic awkwardness, and finishes with a high-speed, playful chase. It feels like a sunny weekend date gone hilariously wrong but remaining affectionate.

- **Prompt for Music AI**:
  - **Chinese**: 纯音乐，无歌词，甜蜜的城市流行，Kawaii Future Bass，808鼓点，节奏感强。前奏温馨自信，中段加入滑稽的故障音效，结尾变成快节奏的追逐曲。合成器音色明亮可爱，贝斯律动感强。
  - **English**: `Instrumental, No Lyrics, Sweet City Pop, Kawaii Future Bass, Upbeat, 808 Drum Machine, Catchy Synth Lead. Starts romantic and confident, transitions into a comedic glitchy section, ends with a fast-paced playful chase theme. Bright and happy vibe.`
